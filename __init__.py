This package exposes a Typer-based CLI and a small set of modules for:
- catalog building (dataset -> tables/items.csv)
- batch creation (freeze a run, create a queue)
- run worker (claim jobs, run adapters, append results.parquet)
- metrics compute (fill/update metrics)
- report build (summaries for analysis)
