Consider the description of the project we are developing provided in the files.
Compare the content of the GitHub repository and the description of the project contained in the PRD file inside the same repository.
Your task is to assess if: 1) the content of the GitHub repository is consisnte, in other words if there are some misalignments or incongruences or redundant or unused files inside the source code 2) the content of the GitHub repository is aligned with the project scope 3) if the content of the PRD reflects exactly the actual content of the repository 4) suggest eventual corrections to be made either at the source code or PRD document
